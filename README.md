### Week 07 & 08 Stroop Data Preparation and Analysis
print("Filtered and prepared Stroop task data for further analysis in week 07 R files. In the week 08 assignment file, the means and standard deviations were analyzed to compare the reaction times of those who responded with congruent and incongruent answers on the Stroop test. There was a higher average reaction time for those with incongruent responses (as can be observed in the figure below).")
